# PreOrder-Traversal-of-a-Binary-Tree\
PreOrder Traversal works by visiting the root of the tree, then traverses the left of the tree, and then the right of a tree.
The values in the node are added to an ArrayList based on the order of the traversal. This repository contains code that 
traverses through a tree in preorder.
